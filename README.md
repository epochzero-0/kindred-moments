##  Overview

**Kindred Moments** is a mobile-first progressive web application built to foster genuine human connections within Singapore neighbourhoods. The app matches residents based on shared interests, location proximity, and social comfort levels, facilitating both 1-on-1 connections and interest-based group activities.

### Key Philosophy
- **Hyperlocal Focus**: All features center around Singapore neighbourhoods (Punggol, Tampines, Woodlands, etc.)
- **Low-Pressure Socializing**: Respects introvert/ambivert/extrovert preferences
- **Data-Driven Matching**: Uses interests, mood, free time slots, and languages for smart connections
- **Community Wellness**: Integrates mood tracking, journaling, and breathing exercises

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **SessionStorage for State** - Enables state persistence without backend, simulates real user experience
2. **Custom Event System** - Allows cross-component communication (e.g., chat updates)
3. **Component-First Architecture** - Explore page split into focused components for maintainability
4. **Three.js Integration** - Full 3D scene for unique, memorable visualization
5. **AI Message Generation** - Context-aware icebreakers based on shared interests

---

## Singapore-Specific Features

- **15 HDB Neighbourhoods** mapped (Punggol, Tampines, Woodlands, Bedok, etc.)
- **SingPass Integration** (mocked) for identity verification
- **Multilingual Support** (English, Mandarin, Malay, Tamil, Hokkien)
- **Local Activities** (kopi sessions, hawker food hunts, void deck gatherings)
- **Cultural Sensitivity** in comfort level settings

---

## Future Roadmap

- [ ] Backend API integration (Supabase/Firebase)
- [ ] Real-time chat with WebSockets
- [ ] Push notifications
- [ ] Event creation and RSVP
- [ ] Photo sharing in chats
- [ ] Voice messages
